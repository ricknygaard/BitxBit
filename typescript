[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.  It has many fea‐[m
     tures to process text files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward,[m
     and extensible.[m
[m
     If you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you don't like the Perl ugliness, or you do[m
     like the concept of LISP, but don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of choice.[m
[m
[1mFEATURES[0m[m
     Ruby's features are as follows:[m
[m
     [1mInterpretive[0m[m
             Ruby is an interpreted language, so you don't have to recompile programs written in Ruby to execute[m
             them.[m
[m
     [1mVariables[0m [1mhave[0m [1mno[0m [1mtype[0m [1m(dynamic[0m [1mtyping)[0m[m
             Variables in Ruby can contain data of any type.  You don't have to worry about variable typing.  Con‐[m
             sequently, it has a weaker compile time check.[m
[m
     [1mNo[0m [1mdeclaration[0m [1mneeded[0m[m
             You can use variables in your Ruby programs without any declarations.  Variable names denote their[m
             scope - global, class, instance, or local.[m
[m
     [1mSimple[0m [1msyntax[0m[m
             Ruby has a simple syntax influenced slightly from Eiffel.[m
